    "### Friend Suggestion (Bidirectional Dijkstra)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Introduction:**\n",
    "Social networks are live on the connections between people, so friend\n",
    "suggestions is one of the most important features of Facebook. One of\n",
    "the most important inputs of the algorithm for friend suggestion is most\n",
    "probably the current distance between you and the suggested person\n",
    "in the graph of friends connections. Your task is to implement efficient\n",
    "computation of this distance. The grader will test your algorithm against\n",
    "different real-world networks, such as a part of internet, a network of\n",
    "scientific citations or coauthorship, a social network of jazz musicians or\n",
    "even a social network of dolphins :) You need to compute the distance\n",
    "between two nodes in such network. We took some of the graphs from\n",
    "here to use in the grader, and you can play with more of them on your\n",
    "own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python, Ruby and Javascript are too slow to solve\n",
    "the largest tests in time, so solutions in these languages won’t\n",
    "be tested against some of the largest tests. Solutions in C++,\n",
    "Java, C#, Haskell and Scala will be tested against all the tests.\n",
    "Note that we only guarantee (as usual) that there exists a solution\n",
    "under the given time and memory constraints for C++,\n",
    "Java and Python3. For other languages, the solution may not\n",
    "exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Compute the distance between several pairs of nodes in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format:** The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ — the number of nodes and edges in the\n",
    "network, respectively. The nodes are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each of the following $m$ lines contains\n",
    "three integers $u$, $v$ and $l$ describing a directed edge $(u, v)$ of length $l$ from the node number $u$ to the\n",
    "node number $v$. (Note that some social networks are represented by directed graphs while some other\n",
    "correspond naturally to undirected graphs. For example, Twitter is a directed graph (with a directed\n",
    "edge $(u, v)$ meaning that $u$ follows $v$), while Facebook is an undirected graph (where an undirected\n",
    "edge $\\{u, v\\}$ means that $u$ and $v$ are friends). In this problem, we work with directed graphs only for a\n",
    "simple reason. It is easy to turn an undirected graph into a directed one: just replace each undirected\n",
    "edge $\\{u, v\\}$ with a pair of directed edges $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line contains an integer $q$ — the number of queries for computing the distance. Each of the\n",
    "following $q$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ — the numbers of the two nodes to compute the distance\n",
    "from $u$ to $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:** $1 \\leq n \\leq 1000000; 1 \\leq m \\leq 6000000; 1 \\leq u, v \\leq n; 1 \\leq l \\leq 1000; 1 \\leq q \\leq 1000$. For Python2, Python3, Ruby and Javascript, $1 \\leq m \\leq 2000000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:** For each query, output one integer on a separate line. If there is no path from $u$ to $v$,\n",
    "output $−1$. Otherwise, output the distance from $u$ to $v$."
