# Mock interview with Nicat Aydemirov (Expedia)

1) How did you deal with getting requests from multiple groups with different goals and priorities?

a. When talking about the previous company, it is on point for you to mention the company name
b. Stay on the focus of the question - the question was about multiple groups with different goals, where you stated that requirements came from the same team, but different requirements.

2) Tell me about a time when you had a difficult challenge at work that pushed your abilities to their limits.

a. Do not use rude wording - meaningless - instead use “unnecessary”

3) Tell me about a time when someone confronted you about a bug/issue you created, or about your work that was less than optimal

a. It would be better to mention that might have happened due to you being earlier in your career. 


P.S.
1) if manager doesn't agree with your solution, tell him this is all the pros and cons, and now it is your call to make decision.
2) never overyell your manager, follow subordination rules.
3) don't do anything unethical, even if your manager askes to do, report about it to higher leadership.
