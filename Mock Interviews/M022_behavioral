# Mock Interview with Nijat Aydamirov (Expedia)

1) Tell me about a time when you managed and pitched an idea to a superior
2) Imagine that you noticed a colleague demonstrating difficulty accepting and being inclusive of others
3) Tell me about a time when your project team started losing focus


I liked how you talked with passion - using hand gestures and emotions. That eliminates the language barrier with the interviewer. 
Solid usage of the language. 
Good usage of the STAR method. 
Keep the introduction shorter (2-3 sentences). Hop to the topic as soon as possible. 
Do not include exact deep technical details of your solution - wait for follow-up questions - they will be there. 
Always keep in mind time - you are expected to have on average 5 minutes per question
Please don't forget to use pauses as much as possible.
Work on logical conclusion. 
Make sure you do not go away from the topic. 


7/10

P.S.
- Focus on your resume
- No need to have all the scenarios, you can start "Honestly, such a situation hasn't occurred but if it had, I would ..."
